<p>This is a simple project I used to learn and practice <a href="https://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">EmberJS</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Diceware</strong> is a method for creating passphrases,
    passwords, and other cryptographic variables using an ordinary dice as a
    hardware random number generator.</p>

  <p>This app attempts to simulate rolling six sided dice and using the results
  to lookup a word in the {{#link-to "words"}}word list{{/link-to}}.</p>

  <p>Say you need a password for your Wi-Fi. And say you don't want to write
  down 128 characters of random gibberish converted to <em>l33t</em>
  speak everytime someone asks you for the password. Diceware was the idea of
  creating randomized passwords which were memerable and procedurally
  generated by rolling a few six sided dice. Granted I'm an <em>old
  school</em> fan; I just couldn't carry 6 dice and list of 7000+ words in my
  pocket.</p>
  <p>Enter <strong>Virtual Diceware</strong>. Simply open the app (like it is
  now), let the randomness build, then {{#link-to "index"}}generate a
  pasword{{/link-to}}. You can then copy paste a reasonable password into your
  Wi-Fi admin settings.</p>

  <p>GRC's (Gibson Research Corporation) Ultra High Entropy Pseudo Random
  Number Generator is a bit of <span>JavaScript</span> code by Steve Gibson.
  It's intent is to build a large amount of entropy for random number
  generation.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h4>What's so special about this pseudo-random number generator?</h4>
    <p>This carefully designed PRNG utilizes more than 1536 bits of internal
    &ldquo;state&rdquo; memory. The operating parameters of the generator's
    algorithm were carefully chosen (it uses a &ldquo;safe prime&rdquo; factor)
    to guarantee that every possible PRNG &ldquo;state&rdquo; is visited before
    the sequence begins to repeat. The result is that the &ldquo;period&rdquo;
    of this generator will be the &ldquo;Germain prime&rdquo; 1,768,863 x 21535
    - 1, which is approximately 2.132 x 10468. This is such a large number that
    it might as well be infinite. This generator effectively never repeats.</p>
