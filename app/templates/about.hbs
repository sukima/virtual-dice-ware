<h2>What is Diceware?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Diceware</strong> is a method for creating passphrases, passwords, and other cryptographic variables using an ordinary dice as a hardware random number generator.</p>

<h2>What is GRC's UHE PRNG?</h2>

<p>GRC's (Gibson Research Corporation) Ultra High Entropy Pseudo Random Number Generator is a bit of <span>JavaScript</span> code by Steve Gibson. It's intent is to build a large amount of entropy for random number generation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4>What's so special about this pseudo-random number generator?</h4>
  <p>This carefully designed PRNG utilizes more than 1536 bits of internal &ldquo;state&rdquo; memory. The operating parameters of the generator's algorithm were carefully chosen (it uses a &ldquo;safe prime&rdquo; factor) to guarantee that every possible PRNG &ldquo;state&rdquo; is visited before the sequence begins to repeat. The result is that the &ldquo;period&rdquo; of this generator will be the &ldquo;Germain prime&rdquo; 1,768,863 x 21535 - 1, which is approximately 2.132 x 10468. This is such a large number that it might as well be infinite. This generator effectively never repeats.</p>
